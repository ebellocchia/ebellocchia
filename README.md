Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Emanuele, Italian by origin but living in Germany.

I'm a software developer working mainly with C++ and Python, though I love exploring and experimenting with new languages.

I enjoy writing code in my free time even though I already do it at work. It's both fun and relaxing for me. You'll find some of my projects in the repositories here, while others I've developed as paid work are kept private.

I like to keep my repositories clean and functional, even if they have few or zero stars. It's a matter of principle for me: I'm a perfectionist at heart ðŸ˜….
